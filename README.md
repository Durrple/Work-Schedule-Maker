# Challenge-5: Creating a schedule app to log tasks for the typical hours of a workday.
## Description: 
  ## For challenge 5, I used JavaScript to make the time blocks in this schedule app change color depending on what hour it is during the day. It also shows the current date and time at the top of the page. When you input text into the time blocks, if you click the save button, it will save your text to local storage so when you refresh the page your information is still there.
